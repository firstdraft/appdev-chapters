# How to Start Working on Your Own Project

## Find Our Base Repository
We keep a blank Rails application that includes all the third-party libraries that we use in class. [You can find it here](https://github.com/appdev-projects/base-rails)

## Create Your Own Copy
Once you reach the base-rails repository, you can generate your own copy by clicking the green “Use this template” button.

You can select to create a copy to your Personal account or your class organization, it’s up to you!

## Open in Gitpod
Once you have your own copy of base-rails, you need to open it in Gitpod.

First, copy the URL of the repository you generated.

(It should look something like `https://github.com/your-organization/my-really-good-app-idea`)

Then in the address bar type, gitpod.io/# , and then paste the URL of your repository that you copied right after the `#` and hit `return`.

If you’re signed into Gitpod, this will create a workspace for you based on your repository. You can follow these steps any time you want to start a new project.
